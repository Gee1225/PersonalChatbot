Early Life and Education  
George Agyeah is a Ghanaian-born economist and data scientist whose journey spans multiple countries and languages.

After completing the exchange and returning to Ghana, Agyeah received a scholarship to pursue his bachelor’s degree in Economics at Saint Petersburg State Economics University in Russia. During his time in Russia (2011–2016), he distinguished himself both academically and as a student leader – serving as president of the National Union of Ghanaian Students in St. Petersburg and even acting as a translator for Ghana’s visiting Vice President Kwesi Amissah-Arthur at an economic forum. His multicultural experience is reflected in the five languages he speaks fluently (including Russian), a skill that underscores his global perspective.
